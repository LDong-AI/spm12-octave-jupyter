## What is this

This is a repository with content to illustrate the use of [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/) for fMRI analysis in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) running [octave-kernel](https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel) on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

It currently has two notebooks:
- [`spm12_octave_jupyter_basics.ipynb`](#spm12_octave_jupyter_basics.ipynb) - which runs through some basic commands and functonalities
- [`spm12_scripting_tutorial.ipynb`](#spm12_scripting_tutorial.ipynb) - which is a step by step SPM12 scripting tutorial based on [this blog post](https://jsheunis.github.io/2018-06-28-spm12-matlab-scripting-tutorial-3/)

More content will follow...
